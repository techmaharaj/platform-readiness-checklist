# Platform Adoption Readiness Assessment Tool

This repository contains a comprehensive checklist and assessment tool to help organizations evaluate their readiness for platform engineering adoption. This was presented as part of the "Are you really ready to adopt a platform?" talk at KubeCon Salt Lake City, 2024.
The assessment covers five key areas and provides a structured approach to understanding your organization's preparedness for platform adoption.

## 📋 What's Included

- Platform Readiness Assessment Checklist (PDF)
- Scoring guide and readiness levels
- Action planning templates
- Recommendations based on assessment scores

## 🎯 Purpose

The assessment tool helps organizations:
- Evaluate their current state of platform engineering readiness
- Identify gaps and areas needing improvement
- Create actionable plans for platform adoption
- Make informed decisions about timing and approach for platform initiatives

## 🔍 Assessment Areas

1. Organizational Alignment
2. Current State Assessment
3. Technical Readiness
4. Organizational Change Readiness
5. Operational Readiness

## 📊 Scoring

Each section is scored on a 4-point scale:
1. Not Ready
2. Partially Ready
3. Mostly Ready
4. Fully Ready

Total possible score: 100 points across all sections.
